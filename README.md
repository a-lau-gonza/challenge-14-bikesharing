## Overview of Project

The challenge given to me this week was to create support for a proposal for the purpose of developing a bike share program in Des Moines. As the stakeholders need more visual data to sway them in investing for the opportunity to create its own share of another city's transportation. As such, each data visualized graph was created to support the idea that the bikes would be used regularly by the local population for a constant income revenue.

## Results
* First of all, we have the following graph that shows the proportion of regular subscribers to one-time customers for the bike rentals. The find that there are repeat users of a bike sharing program shows the *potential* in having a __*constant revenue stream each month*__. A large __majority__ of users end up becoming subscribers, meaning many of them view the program as a reliable and consistent mode of transportation along with the others available in the city.

* Next, we have the amount of time which the users typically rent the bikes for. With a large number of users using them for under 10 minutes, this shows that for short distances users will *still* if not *mostly* use the bikes. This most likely shows an __advantage__ to being convenient to use over the metro, or by car to a destination. The bikes provide the ability to travel anywhere accessible without having to know where the closest metro station is and also avoiding expensive taxi fare or car parking. 

![Checkout Times for Users](Write-Up_Resources/Checkout_Users.png)

* With the following graph, we have it distinctly separated by the genders using our bikes. The *majority* of users are men, whereas women follow suit, and still a large number of users choose not to disclose that information. As the market share for men is already established, a *push in marketing or change in bike design for more women to use the bikes* would be ideal in gaining as many users as possible. For a "traditionalist" mindset when it comes to why they aren't using them as much. __It may be due to multiple factors including but not limited to: footwear choice, clothing choice, and storage available on the bike itself.__

* As with the darker areas in the following graph, __*rush hour*__ is still a large reason as to why people will use a bike. After all, it is another form of transportation and *9 to 5* daily work hours makes sense for how often and when regular users will ride our bikes. With a regular working force, the numbers of regular users will fluctuate with that for those who work in the city.

* This is again a graphical representation of the frequency in which gender uses the bikes more frequently. As noted before, 9 to 5 workdays do indeed provide a significant impact in bike usage.

![Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)](Write-Up_Resources/Trips_by_Gender_WD.png)

* The following graph shows the difference in one-time customers and subscribers in daily usage. As expected, the __*typical 9 to 5, Monday to Friday weekday*__ workweek is a common factor in regular users. The customers are more spread out in usage throughout the week, likely being a combination of those with differing workdays, schooldays, or tourists.

* Finally, the following graph shows the bike usage is __not__ uniform among all the bikes available in the city they were deployed. The deduction that can be made is due to *high traffic areas*, either tourist destinations, metro stations, certain workplaces, etc. These will most likely see regular use to and from other areas due to high *foot traffic*.

## Summary
* If there is to be more data to squeeze out in terms of supporting the proposal to provide these bikes, they would be two-fold: 
  * Find out the regular foot traffic areas within the city. The largest office companies, most populated areas, tourist attractions, and metro stations would all be logical places to plant and find our used bikes.
  * Next, would be to find good data on what regular subscribers like and don't like our bikes. This can help in attracting new subscribers and customers, especially in bringing in more women riders.

* There is an argument to be made for having another bike sharing program in Des Moines for another consistent income for the company. It can be a large cut in to the massive market of transportation within the city, having *advantages* over car/ride sharing programs and even other modes public transportation in a field that can only be fought against by other bike sharing programs. As regular users in a city with a large office working population can have the income stream be consistent as long as they need to go to work in-person, of which is still the norm (pre-COVID).
